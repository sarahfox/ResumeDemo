Sarah has amazing talents when it comes to the language of computers.  She is truly one of Joel of Software's 10x coders in terms of productivity.  In the seven years of working together I saw Sarah pick up many new concepts and meld them into her approach.  These include key contributions in refining our products to run virtually bug free.  Analytical skills - outstanding.  Code readability - top notch, very gifted in this area.  Believes in writing code comments!  Good memory.  Practical judgment when considering technology tradeoffs."
